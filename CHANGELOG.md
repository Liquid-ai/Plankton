## 0.6.0
### General

- Migration to ROS 2 Foxy
- Added support for Gazebo 11
- Files parsed by Xacro are now directly output as a string and loaded as a node parameter in the various launch files
- Known issue: teleop shows unexpected behaviour with the trajectory control package's controllers, as well as the rov_mb_sm controller / rov_nl_pid_controller
- Known issue: the CPC sensor and the custom battery plugins crash when loaded
- Known issue: DVL and camera sensor won't show in Rviz
- Known issue: The subprocess based sim time request fails when the plankton sim time node is launched within the same launch file. A simple fix is to start the sim time node first and separately

### uuv_thruster_manager

- [**thruster_manager.py**] The thruster manager now gets and parse the urdf robot description from a topic instead of a file 

## 0.5.3

### General

- Fixed a problem where the simulated time request was not correctly handled while using subprocess and failed
- Fixed many issues occuring in the trajectory control and control utils
- Known issues: teleop shows unexpected behaviour with the trajectory control package's controllers, as well as the rov_mb_sm controller / rov_nl_pid_controller when station is keeping on.
- Known issues: the CPC sensor and the custom battery plugins crash when loaded
- Increased the timeout while waiting for the tf transforms in the thruster_manager
- Reverted yaml format for file-based waypoints to plain old yaml as the values are not read as ROS parameters

### plankton_utils

- Increased the default timeout for sim time request to 10s

### uuv_control_utils

## 0.5.0

## General

- General migration of UUV simulator to ROS 2 Eloquent  
- Gazebo plugins now instantiate 1 ROS node per plugin  
- Parameters are auto declared in each node  
- Sim time: current solution implies that each Plankton node asks at startup for the use or not of use_sim_time to a global node created when initializing gazebo  
- Some occurrences can remain, but tf_prefix is not used anymore
- The provided Gazebo world files were modified to load the gazebo_ros_state plugin. The gazebo_ros_force_system plugin is also loaded in the launch files initializing gazebo  
- The official Gazebo ros plugins live in their own namespace `/gazebo`  

## Missing from ROS 1

- Currently removed the ability for nodes to respawn if they were parameterized in this way in the launch file  
- Currently removed the ability to stop the ROS 2 system if a node tagged as required in the launch file terminates  
- Currently not migrated `UnderwaterCamera` and `sonar_image sensor plugins`  
- The assistant tools to create new robots are not ported yet  
- Model_spawner has not been ported yet and was replaced with the default entity_spawner of gazebo

### uuv_auv_control_allocator

- [**actuator_manager**] Renamed topic `/${namespace}/${topic_prefix}/${id}/${topic_suffix}` to `/${namespace}/${topic_prefix}/id_${id}/${topic_suffix}` according to ROS 2 naming convention.

### uuv_cascaded_pids

### uuv_control_msgs

- [**GetMBSMControllerParams**, **SetMBSMControllerParams**] Changed field `lambda` as it is a reserved keyword in Python
- [**GetPIDParams**, **SetPIDParams**, **SetSMControllerParams**, **GetSMControllerParams**] Turned field names to lowercase names as it is now a required convention

### uuv_control_utils

- Changed yaml syntax for the files used in *disturbance_manager.py* and *send_waypoints.py* due to ROS 2 limitations with sequences. 
Each disturbance now lives in a namespace `d${X}`, where `${X}` is the number of the disturbance.
Each waypoint now lives in a namespace `wp${X}` where `${X}` is the number of the waypoint.
Two example files are provided.
- [**apply_link_wrench**] The file was renamed from *apply_body_wrench* to reflect the name change of the Gazebo ros service .
The service name and message type were modified to `apply_link_wrench` and `ApplyLinkWrench` respectively, according to (https://github.com/ros-simulation/gazebo_ros_pkgs/wiki/ROS-2-Migration:-Body-Wrench-and-Joint-Effort)
